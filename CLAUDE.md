# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working on the new hosting discount platform to be built from scratch.

## Project Context

This document analyzes an existing Flask-based hosting comparison platform as reference for building a **new Next.js application from scratch** with modern technologies:

**Target Tech Stack:**
- **Frontend:** Next.js with shadcn/ui components
- **Database:** Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **UI Components:** shadcn/ui
- **IDs:** UUID for all entities
- **Authentication:** Supabase Auth

## Current Project Status

**‚úÖ Completed Setup:**
- Next.js 15.5.0 project initialized with TypeScript
- App Router structure configured
- Tailwind CSS v4 integrated
- shadcn/ui components library configured (New York style)
- Development server running on `http://localhost:3000`
- Turbopack enabled for faster development
- Lucide React icons library
- ESLint configured
- Supabase MCP server connected

**üîß Development Commands:**
- `npm run dev` - Start development server on port 3000 (with Turbopack)
- `npm run build` - Build production application (with Turbopack)
- `npm run start` - Start production server
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint

**üìÅ Project Structure:**
```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app/                # Next.js App Router
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ globals.css     # Global styles with Tailwind
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ layout.tsx      # Root layout component
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ page.tsx        # Home page
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components/         # Reusable components (shadcn/ui)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ lib/               # Utility functions
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ utils.ts       # Tailwind utilities
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ public/            # Static assets
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ components.json    # shadcn/ui configuration
```

**üéØ Immediate Next Steps:**
1. **Database Schema Setup**: Create Supabase tables for Users, Providers, Plans, Reviews
2. **Environment Configuration**: Set up `.env.local` with Supabase credentials
3. **Supabase Client Setup**: Configure Supabase client in Next.js
4. **Basic UI Components**: Add essential shadcn/ui components (Button, Input, Card, etc.)
5. **Authentication Flow**: Implement Supabase Auth with login/register pages
